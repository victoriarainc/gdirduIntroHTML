# Girl Develop It
## Intro to HTML/CSS
Girl Develop It hosts classes on web basics such as HTML and CSS. Their mission is to empower women in the community to join the tech community through web development and/or design.
I am the Teaching Assistant for October's Intro to HTML and CSS class. It is a four part class that meets once a week to break down and practice the basics. We cover file organization, editing in Atom, classes and ids, elements, styling, and the box model.
